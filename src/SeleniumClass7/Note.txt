Selenium Class7

Handling multiple windows (tab):
In order to handel multiple windows we will be using:
getWindowHandel()
getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
             Is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or tab
             It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID

synchronization:
            Is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components the same level
            In this case we are bringing out script and page load to the sane speed level

Thread.sleep(); --- static wait / unconditional wait


Types of selenium waits:
Implicit wait
Explicit wait
fluent wait

Implicit wait:
               It tells the webDriver to wait for certain amount of time before throwing an exception
               It will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution
               we can sy that implicit wait is a global wait
