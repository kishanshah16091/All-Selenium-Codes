Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop-up message. Alert takes a compete focus of our main page that we are working on we cannot proceed
until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
1. web base alerts/html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform need actions
2. javascript alerts/ browser alerts - we can handel these alerts by using switchTo method
                                       we cannot inspect
3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handel with selenium

Types of Javascript alert
1. simple alert - click ok
2. confirmation Alert - either cancel or click ok
3. prompt alert - enter the text and then click ok or cancel

To handel JS alerts we only have 4 method:
1. accept(); - click ok
2. dismiss(); - click cancel
3. getText(); -
4. sendKeys(); -

To handel authentication alerts we need to pass username and password in the URL
 public static String url = ("https://admin:admin@the-internet.herokuapp.com/basic_auth");
                                    //username:password@

Frames
frame is a separate independent window on our webpage
Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact with frame:
1. by index
2. by name or ID
3. by webElement

in alerts - switch to alert and switch automatically back
in frames - switch to a frame manually and switch manually back to the main page
